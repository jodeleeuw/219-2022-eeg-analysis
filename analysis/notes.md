# Methods

Include details about norming study and link to appendix?

# Results

## Behavioral

These are pretty clear, no need for variants.

### Delayed Naming

### Comprehension

Luck chp 4 suggests a step function (average window of 100ms, then next 100ms, compute difference, compare to threshold).

### N1
